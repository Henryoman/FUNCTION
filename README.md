# Tom's Myspace Page

This is a static recreation of [Tom's 2006 Myspace page](https://web.archive.org/web/20060423020134/myspace.com/tom). 

You can view a live version of this project on [Github Pages](https://wittenbrock.github.io/myspace-website-clone/).

The goal of this project was to solidify my knowledge of CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid by building a website with a relatively complex layout.
